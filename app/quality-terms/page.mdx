<br />

This page will serve as the foundation for a living database of terms that represent and describe high quality across disciplines.  

(Definition is destiny — we can't aim at what we can't define.)

## Coming Soon

We’re currently developing this section. Once complete, it will include:

- **Quality Term Database** — a structured collection of words and phrases that convey excellence or desirable qualities in various fields  
- **Quality Data Model** — an extensible, self-describing schema that captures the kinds of qualities these words point to (e.g., clarity, integrity, harmony)  
- **Quality-Centered Lexicon** — a language model built around qualities rather than objects, designed to support more perceptive analysis and communication  

Check back soon.
