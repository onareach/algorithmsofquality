Longer-form explorations of quality theory, its philosophical foundations, and practical applications.

## Articles

**[Two Definitions of Quality](/writings/two-definitions-of-quality)** — The word "quality" has two distinct but interconnected meanings that shape how we perceive and evaluate the world. This foundational article explores quality as both characteristic and excellence, revealing the deep connection between perception and evaluation.

**[Expanding the Realm of Science to Include Good](/writings/expanding-the-realm-of-science-to-include-good)** — Just as consciousness has entered scientific inquiry, Quality (or *good*) must be recognized as foundational to science itself. This article explores how Quality is not peripheral but essential to scientific reasoning, and how expanding our conception of truth to include harmony and benefit can transform scientific ontology.
